The tests in this section are "black box" tests or, put another way, tests
which test the system as a whole without concerning the code behind the module.

To run the tests, you will need to have node installed (obviously!) and have a
version of python as the SMTP client uses the built in one in python's standard
library. The tests have all been verified with python 2.5.

The tests require the testing server to be running. In the current directory:

$ node test-server.js

Then you can run the tests that you want:

$ python <name of test>.py.

For unit tests, see the "unit tests" section.
